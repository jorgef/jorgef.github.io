Time is a precious and limited resource. Spend it wisely, and avoid unnecessary distractions. Dedicate quality time to your family, and strive to be a loving father and husband. Plan your day to make most of it and reinforce good habits.

Growth is achieved through a combination of stress and rest. Skills come from struggle and you grow when you rest. Even when you don't feel motivated, make an effort to show up and give your best. The best performers are not consistently great but they are great at being consistent.
