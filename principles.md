# Priciples

## 1. Integrity in Action: Leading by Example
Always strive to do the right thing, especially when it's difficult or challenging. Control your emotions and maintain a composed voice. Recognize that your actions can influence others. Embrace a positive attitude, smile often, and actively contribute to the journey of everyone around you.

## 2. Time: Our Most Valuable Asset
Time is a precious and limited resource. Spend it wisely, and avoid unnecessary distractions. Dedicate quality time to your family, and strive to be a loving father and husband. Plan your day to make most of it and reinforce good habits.

## 3. Growth: Stress + Rest, Consistently 
Growth is achieved through a combination of stress and rest. Skills come from struggle and you grow when you rest. Even when you don't feel motivated, make an effort to show up and give your best. The best performers are not consistently great but they are great at being consistent. 

## 4. Well-being: Physical and Mental Health
Prioritize your well-being by maintaining physical and mental health. Adopt a balanced diet with a focus on low carbohydrate intake and mindful (slow) eating. Engage in regular exercise at least three times a week and floss your teeth every night. Cultivate a lifelong learning mindset, stay connected to the details, challenge your mind, and practice meditation at least twice a week.â€¨

## 5. Embrace Imperfection: Learn, Apologize, and Grow
Be patient and understanding with yourself, recognizing that everyone makes mistakes. Embrace your humanity, apologize when necessary, reflect on your actions, learn from them, and then move forward with a renewed mindset and a commitment to growth.
